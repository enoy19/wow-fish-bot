# wow-fish-bot
extremely simple and stupid ( and probably not always working ) fishing bot for world of warcraft.
I made this because I needed some deviate fish.

I just saw [julianperrott fishing bot](https://github.com/julianperrott/FishingFun) that looks amazing. I didn't use it... but check that out if you really want a fishing bot that doesn't need too much configuration.

## Little disclaimer... 
I don't really know but I assume that blizzard doesn't like people who bot... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That's why I leave this little disclaimer: This Project is solely for
